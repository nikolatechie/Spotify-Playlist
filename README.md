# Spotify-Playlist
Covered the <i>ETL process</i> by using <b>Python</b> to create a data pipeline that daily downloads songs (used <b>Apache Airflow</b>) played in the past 24 hours (accessing to the playlist done by using <i>Spotify API</i>), transforms the data into appropriate format and saves the playlist in the <b>SQLite database</b>.
<br>Useful for finding out things such as the most/least played song, favorite band, favorite genre etc.
